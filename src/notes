General Notes/Ideas:

Basic Implementation, Summary:
Purpose: To create a basic database of ships and harbors.
The Admin will be able to add, remove, and edit harbors and ships via a "World
Map" GUI.
The User will be able to query the database via a

Advanced Implementation, Summary:
Purpose: To turn this into an interactive game, as opposed to just a database.
The Admin will be able to create starting maps. The user will be able to manage
a single country's resources and ships to wage war on the others (or live
peacefully...).

NOTE: Perhaps use a trinity of military ships:
	-Carrier > Destroyer
	-Submarine > Carrier
	-Destroyer > Submarine


Implementation:

---Basic Implementation:-------------------------------------------------------
Admin can edit data, User can query data. Data is static
Most data held by <Ship>s. A little held by <Harbor>s.

"Has A" Hierarchy:

GUI -> <WorldMap> -> <Harbor>s - > <Ship>s

Admin GUI:
[ ] Can add, edit, and remove <Harbor>s.
	[ ] Add and Edit: Must have unique names and coordinates.
	[ ] Blackbox test. (No ships, no harbors, no ships + no harbors).
[ ] Can add, edit, and remove <Ship>s in any <Harbor>.
	[ ] Only name and country-of-origin will be editable (no superpower ships).
	[ ] Like <Harbor>, must have unique names and coordinates.
	[ ] Blackbox test. (Blank names)
	
User GUI:
[ ] Can query data from the World Map.
	[ ] Query data pertaining to one or more <Harbor>s.
[ ] Clicking on a <Harbor> will display relevant information about it:
	[ ] List of ships.
	[ ] Country it belongs to.
	
---Advanced Implementation:----------------------------------------------------
Game is run by turns, with each player taking a turn in a random but permanent
order. (i.e. randomized for 4 players, turn order can be 4213, 4213, etc.).
[ ] Resources generated per turn:
	[ ] Harbor tax: Any Resources generated by other players in your harbor
		will be taxed.
	[ ]Fishing ships: Automatically generates Resources depending on harbor.
		[ ] Diminished Supplies: A single ship at a harbor will generate 1.0x
			of Resources, but due to "overcrowding", more ships at a harbor
			will lower the return rate, perhaps at a "1/x"-ish curve.
		[ ] Resource Trade: Resources generated at foreign harbor "A" will have
			to be moved to your own harbor "B" before they can be spent.
			Resources generated at foreign harbors will stockpile there, to a
			limit, until they are moved.
		[ ] Foreign Goods: The amount of Resources generated at each harbor
			depends on:
		 	1) Proximity to base harbor (further = better)
		 	2) Foreign or domestic (foreign = better)
		 	This reinforces the real world idea of "No risk, no reward."
