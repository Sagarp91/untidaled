<h4>Gameplay</h4>
You are in charge of your country's harbors (in blue). Over time, your harbors will generate money. This rate can be increased by purchasing fisher and barge ships for that harbor.  
Purchase cruisers and destroyers for a harbor, and then left-click that harbor and another harbor to send a fleet. Fleets can conquer enemy harbors and reinforce your own harbors.  
Be careful when reinforcing your own harbors! Harbors have a cap to how many ships they can hold; any excess ships will be destroyed.

Note that barges generate twice as much money over time than fishers. These are efficient in terms of your harbor's capacities, but they cost much more!  
The same idea goes for destroyers vs. cruisers.

<h4>User mode</h4>
In this mode, you can play the game!

<b>Controls</b>

Right-click one of your harbors to bring up a creation menu.

Under this creation menu, you can purchase ships to add to that harbor. Note that while the menu is open, the game will be paused.

Left-click one of your harbors and then left-click a different harbor to send a fleet from the first to the second. (The source harbor must have at least 1 war ship.)

Click on the "Stats" button for a quick look at country stats, including overall wealth and harbors owned. Note that this also pauses the game.  
*ANOTHER NOTE: You must hit the "Close" button rather than the "X" button to close the frame and return to your game.*
